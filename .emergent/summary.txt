The trajectory details the iterative development of Sinister Snare, a Star Citizen piracy intelligence platform. The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a desktop app concept into a functional React + FastAPI web application. Key development phases included fixing a persistent frontend auto-closing issue by simplifying  dependencies and correcting React versions, ensuring backend database stability by resolving MongoDB connection and data serialization errors, and completely migrating from the problematic UEX API to the Star Profit API.

Further work focused on improving data persistence for both MongoDB and IndexedDB, implementing a full SnarePlan external tool integration with correct URL parameters and synchronized terminology, and updating the application's version to v5.0. Most recently, the AI engineer integrated a dynamic data source dropdown (API/Web Crawling), expanded commodity support, and added a Merge feature with averaging logic for routes, alongside a dual view for current/averaged data. The process was highly iterative, with the AI meticulously addressing reported bugs and user requests. The work concludes with the user reporting several new critical issues related to data source handling, missing data in the Commodity Snare, and incomplete route information, which the AI is currently investigating.

<product_requirements>
The user requested Sinister Snare, a tool for Star Citizen players to analyze trading routes and identify optimal piracy interception points. Initially envisioned as a desktop GUI, it was implemented as a local web application (React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database).

Key functionalities:
*   **Live Star Profit API Integration**: Replaced UEXCorp API for real-time market data.
*   **Route Analysis**: Dashboard with charts, heatmaps, time-based scoring, and piracy suggestions.
*   **Data Export**: CSV, JSON formats.
*   **Real-time Features**: Route tracking, interception point mapping, alert systems for high-value targets, and historical trend analysis.
*   **Action Buttons**: Manual Refresh, Snare Now (most frequent route), and Commodity Snare (commodity-specific interdiction with inter-system warnings).
*   **Local Data Storage**: IndexedDB (frontend) to collect and supplement data, managed via a Database tab displaying size and providing clear/delete options.
*   **Accurate Universe Mapping**: Correctly maps in-game terminals to Star Citizen star systems (Stanton, Pyro, Nyx, Terra, Magnus).
*   **Route Code Format**: .
*   **Recent Enhancements (v5.0)**: Dynamic route limit slider, clickable route details with a modal view, integration with  (generating specific URLs with synchronized terminology), a data source selection dropdown (API/Web Crawling), full support for 106 commodities across 128 terminals, a Merge button with averaging logic for duplicate routes, and a dual view for current/averaged data.

        -   Added database-dependent API endpoints: , , , , , , .
        -   Modified route storage logic to use  with UUIDs and timestamps for historical data, rather than .
        -   Implemented a new  endpoint for averaging duplicate route data.
        -   Expanded commodity data handling to 106+ items and 128+ terminals.
        -   Updated API version to v5.0.0.

-   
    -   **Importance**: The main React component responsible for the entire UI, state management, API calls, and user interaction.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Resolved frontend startup issues by simplifying  dependencies (downgraded React to v18.2.0) and adding .
        -   Integrated IndexedDB for local data persistence, with a Database tab for management (clear data, size display).
        -   Implemented UI for Manual Refresh, Snare Now, and Commodity Snare features, including modal components.
        -   Introduced a dynamic route limit slider, updating the  function accordingly.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just completed a significant phase of database and UI enhancements, and subsequently fixed compilation errors arising from these changes. This involved:

1.  **Implementing Data Source Selection**: Added a  state and a dropdown menu in the frontend header allowing users to switch between API and Web Crawling data sources. Sensitive URLs were removed from the dropdown to protect data.
2.  **Expanding Commodity Support**: The backend was extended to fully support 106 commodities across 128 terminals, leveraging the Star Profit API and potential web crawling. The frontend's Commodity Snare modal was updated to display these commodities alphabetically in a grid.
3.  **Merge Functionality**: A  endpoint was implemented in the backend to automatically identify and merge duplicate route data by calculating average values.
4.  **Dual Data View**: A toggle button () was added to the frontend header to allow switching between Current Data (latest individual analyses) and Averaged Data (merged average values).
5.  **Fixing Frontend Compilation Errors**: Resolved issues where state variables (, ) were undefined or used out of scope in the frontend, primarily by correctly passing them as props to components or reordering function definitions.

After these implementations and bug fixes, the system appeared to be operational. However, the user has now reported a new set of critical bugs:
*   The Manual Refresh button is not respecting the  selected in the header dropdown, consistently fetching from the API regardless of selection.
*   The Commodity Snare functionality is failing, displaying ❌ Scrap Analysis Failed with a 404 HTTP error, indicating an issue with fetching commodity-specific data.
*   Route details in the display show Unknown for both Origin and Destination, suggesting a data mapping or retrieval problem.
*   Crucial Buy Price, Sell Price, and Stock information is entirely missing from the route display.

The AI's last action was to acknowledge these issues and initiate debugging, starting with the Manual Refresh data source problem.
