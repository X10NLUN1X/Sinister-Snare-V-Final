The AI engineer successfully transformed a basic application from exhibiting mock data to displaying live, refined data with numerous UI/UX enhancements and critical bug fixes. The journey involved extensive debugging across both frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI) components, addressing data inconsistencies, performance bottlenecks, and user-reported design flaws. Key accomplishments include implementing a realistic piracy scoring system, ensuring interactive elements, correcting geographic data, and creating specialized modes like Hardcore Mode and Commodity Snare. The agent demonstrated proficiency in identifying root causes, applying targeted fixes, and adapting to user feedback, even when it meant reverting complete UI redesigns. The immediate next steps focus on refining the Hardcore Mode display, correcting terminology, and updating icons.

<product_requirements>
The Sinister Snare application is a Star Citizen Piracy Intelligence System aimed at helping players identify profitable and dangerous trade routes.
Initially, the app displayed mock data. The first major requirement was to show live data from the backend. Subsequent requests focused on:
1.  **Data Accuracy & Functionality**: Fix incorrect numbers in Local Database Management, show real Live Tracking uptime, and display correct Investment/ROI values in Commodity Snare.
2.  **Realistic Piracy Scoring**: Implement a realistic V2.0 Piracy Score, de-emphasizing inter-system routes and prioritizing system-internal ones.
3.  **UI/UX Improvements**: Redesign the UI for better aesthetics (e.g., Apple-inspired, then reverted), adjust component sizes, ensure interactive elements (Dashboard Top 3, Commodity Snare), and consolidate action buttons (Refresh, Commodity Snare, Snare Nuke/Hardcore Mode) into the main navigation.
4.  **Content & Information**: Correct Star Citizen geographic data in Snare Mapping, re-add missing Commodity Snare functionality, provide clear definitions for metrics via an FAQ.
5.  **Specialized Modes**: Develop a Hardcore Mode to display only ELITE/LEGENDARY piracy targets with highest intercept rates.
6.  **Performance & Stability**: Resolve infinite loading issues and ensure the application remains responsive and stable through comprehensive debugging.

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack structure:

-   
    -   **Importance**: This file contains the entire FastAPI backend logic, defining all API endpoints, database interactions, and the core business logic for calculating piracy scores and categorizing risk levels.
    -   **Changes Made**: Significant modifications include refining the  function for the Realistic Piracy Score V2.0 and later adjusting its thresholds; fixing data fetching for ; initializing ; correcting geographic mappings for various Star Citizen locations (e.g., Ashland, Deakins Research, CRU-L5); ensuring  opportunity objects returned correct , , and other data; adding a missing  endpoint; and resolving MongoDB ObjectId serialization errors.
-   
    -   **Importance**: This is the main React component. It orchestrates the entire user interface, managing application state, active tabs, data fetching from the backend, rendering different sections (Dashboard, Routes, Map, etc.), and handling user interactions. It integrates all modals and interactive elements.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensively modified to remove mock data, re-enable  functionality, implement various performance optimizations (sequential API calls, timeouts, cache-busting), update UI elements (button sizes, layout proportions, complete redesigns and reverts), integrate new features (FAQ, Commodity Snare, Hardcore Mode), ensure data consistency and interactivity for displayed routes (Dashboard, Commodity Snare), and fix data display bugs (e.g., 0% ROI values) using fallback defaults.

<pending_tasks>
-   Update all remaining instances of Piracy Rating to Piracy Score throughout the UI.
-   Ensure that the Hardcore Mode accurately displays *all* ELITE commodities.
-   Change the icon for the Hardcore Mode button from a lightning bolt (âš¡) to a pirate skull (totenkopf).

<current_work>
The immediate work involved debugging and refining the Hardcore Mode functionality. Previously, the user reported that Gold, an ELITE commodity, was not being displayed in Hardcore Mode, and the mode incorrectly showed no ELITE or LEGENDARY routes despite their existence in the backend.

The AI engineer discovered a data inconsistency where the Hardcore Mode was relying on a global  state that did not contain all ELITE routes, while the  correctly identified Gold as ELITE (with a Piracy Score of 80). The fix involved:
1.  Reverting the  thresholds in  to their original values (ELITE: 80+, LEGENDARY: 90+).
2.  Modifying the  component in  to make its *own fresh API call* to  instead of depending on the potentially outdated  state. This ensures it retrieves all available routes for accurate filtering.
This was intended to ensure Gold, and other ELITE routes, are correctly identified and displayed. However, the user's latest feedback indicates that some aspects (Piracy Rating vs. Score, all ELITE commodities not showing, icon) still need attention.

<optional_next_step>
Address the user's request to change Piracy Rating to Piracy Score in all UI instances.
