<analysis>
The trajectory chronicles the iterative development and extensive bug fixing of Sinister Snare, a Star Citizen piracy intelligence platform. Initially, the AI engineer addressed core application stability, fixing frontend auto-closing issues, ensuring backend database connections, and migrating entirely to the Star Profit API. Subsequent efforts focused on advanced features like IndexedDB persistence, SnarePlan integration, dynamic data source selection, commodity expansion, and a Merge feature for routes with averaging logic.

The conversation then shifted to critical bug resolution in two major phases. The first phase rectified frontend connectivity issues (manual refresh, commodity snare 404, unknown origins, missing price/stock data) by adjusting frontend state handling, creating missing backend endpoints, and updating data models, despite a transient  misconfiguration. The second phase, triggered by new user reports, involved refactoring backend logic to provide diverse commodity routes, implement database upserts, and calculate median values for averaged data. Currently, the AI is debugging the latest issue of incorrect terminal/commodity names by aligning backend data parsing with the actual Star Profit API field names. The process demonstrates robust debugging and an iterative approach to complex feature development and bug resolution.

<product_requirements>
Sinister Snare is a Star Citizen intelligence platform designed to analyze trading routes and identify optimal piracy interception points. It's a local web application built with React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), and MongoDB (database), with IndexedDB for client-side data persistence.

Key functionalities include:
*   **Live Star Profit API Integration**: Provides real-time market data.
*   **Route Analysis**: Displays charts, heatmaps, time-based scoring, and piracy suggestions.
*   **Data Export**: Supports CSV and JSON formats.
*   **Real-time Features**: Route tracking, interception point mapping, alerts for high-value targets, and historical trend analysis.
*   **Action Buttons**: Manual Refresh, Snare Now (most frequent route), and Commodity Snare (commodity-specific interdiction).
*   **Local Data Storage**: IndexedDB for augmenting data, with a Database tab for management.
*   **Accurate Universe Mapping**: Maps in-game terminals to Star Citizen star systems.
*   **Route Code Format**: .
*   **Recent Enhancements (v5.0)**: Dynamic route limit slider, clickable route details with SnarePlan integration, a data source dropdown (API/Web Crawling), full support for 106 commodities across 128 terminals, a Merge button with averaging logic for duplicate routes, and a dual view for current/averaged data.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Terminal and Commodity Name Correction**: Update backend logic to exclusively use correct terminal and commodity names as provided by the Star Profit API, removing any non-existent names (e.g., Outpost C2, Refined Altruciatoxin Grade X).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on resolving a critical data integrity issue reported by the user. The user stated that the application was displaying incorrect terminal names (e.g., Outpost C2) and commodity variants (e.g., Refined Altruciatoxin Grade 4) that do not exist in the Star Citizen universe or the Star Profit API. The user explicitly requested to use only the exact names provided by the API/website.

To address this, the AI engineer took the following steps:
1.  Modified  (Chat Message 161) to remove code responsible for generating or using these incorrect terminal and commodity names.
2.  Specifically, the AI removed Enhanced Commodity Data (Chat Message 163) and web parsing logic (Chat Message 165, 167) which were identified as sources of the erroneous data.
3.  After these changes, a backend restart and test (Chat Messages 168-171) revealed that the  endpoint was returning  and an empty  array. This indicated that the backend was no longer correctly parsing data from the Star Profit API.
4.  The AI then debugged this by directly querying the Star Profit API's commodity endpoint to inspect its actual data structure and field names (Chat Message 173).
5.  It identified that the API uses field names like , , , , and .

The AI is currently in the process of correcting the backend's data parsing logic in  to match these newly identified, correct API field names.
