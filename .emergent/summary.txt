The trajectory chronicles the iterative development and extensive bug fixing of Sinister Snare, a Star Citizen piracy intelligence platform. Initially, the AI engineer addressed core application stability, fixing frontend auto-closing issues, ensuring backend database connections, and migrating entirely to the Star Profit API. Subsequent efforts focused on advanced features like IndexedDB persistence, SnarePlan integration, dynamic data source selection, commodity expansion, and a Merge feature for routes with averaging logic.

The conversation then shifted to critical bug resolution in two major phases. The first phase rectified frontend connectivity issues (manual refresh, commodity snare 404, unknown origins, missing price/stock data) by adjusting frontend state handling, creating missing backend endpoints, and updating data models, despite a transient  misconfiguration. The second phase, triggered by new user reports, involved refactoring backend logic to provide diverse commodity routes, implement database upserts, and calculate median values for averaged data. Currently, the AI is debugging the latest issue of incorrect terminal/commodity names by aligning backend data parsing with the actual Star Profit API field names. The process demonstrates robust debugging and an iterative approach to complex feature development and bug resolution.

<product_requirements>
Sinister Snare is a React, FastAPI, MongoDB application for Star Citizen piracy intelligence. It integrates with the Star Profit API for real-time market data, analyzes trading routes, and suggests piracy interception points, supporting CSV/JSON exports. Key features include Manual Refresh, Snare Now, and Commodity Snare buttons, local IndexedDB storage, and accurate in-game mapping. Recent enhancements (v5.0) added a dynamic route limit, clickable route details with SnarePlan integration, a data source dropdown, full commodity/terminal support, a Merge button with averaging logic, and current/averaged data views. User requests evolved to:
1.  Ensure correct terminal and commodity names, strictly from Star Profit API/verified web sources.
2.  Implement a terminal-to-system mapping for Stanton/Pyro, prioritizing API names, then reliable web sources.
3.  Set Web Crawling as the primary data source, keeping API as secondary.
4.  Add a dropdown for alternative routes in Financial Analysis, displaying exact homepage-like data.
5.  Display Updated: DD.MM.YY HH:mmh timestamp instead of data source info.
6.  Make alternative routes clickable to update the main view.
7.  Redesign Open in Snareplan button (red, pirate flag) and replace Begin Hunt with a generic close button.
8.  Implement internal mapping for Snareplan compatibility (terminal to parent celestial body, excluding specific Lagrange points).
9.  Overhaul Piracy Score to a 0-100 scale based on profit margin, route popularity/distance, and stock availability.
10. Change UI connection text from Star Profit WEB to UEXCorp.

**Key Files and Changes:**

-   
    -   **Importance**: Core FastAPI application, managing API endpoints, data processing, and MongoDB interactions.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        -   MongoDB connection fixed;  serialization replaced with UUIDs.
        -   Migrated from UEXCorp to Star Profit API; UEX references were re-introduced as UI text changes later.
        -   Added  endpoint and fixed it to use fresh data instead of potentially corrupted database entries.
        -    enhanced to correctly extract and map origin/destination systems/terminals, evolving from lore-based to strictly API-driven with a known Stanton, else Pyro rule.  was removed.
        -   Route storage logic updated to use  with .
        -   Web crawling logic in  was completely overhauled to extract real data from the Star Profit website.
        -   Default data source for all endpoints changed from 'api' to 'web'.
        -   New endpoint  created for alternative routes dropdown.
        -    was entirely re-implemented to a 0-100 scale, incorporating profit margin, route popularity/distance, and stock.
        -   All relevant log and  strings (, ) were changed to .

-   **UI Layering Issue**: A modal-overlay () in the frontend sometimes intercepts pointer events, preventing users from clicking on the alternative routes displayed in the dropdown table. This is identified as a UI layering (z-index) problem.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's explicit report that the Alternative Routes functionality was still not interactive, meaning clicking an alternative route did not update the main view.

The AI identified that the  callback function within the  component was not correctly connected to the main application state to trigger a route update. To resolve this, the AI completely re-implemented the  function in . This updated function now correctly integrates the selected alternative route into the main  state, ensuring that the UI reacts and displays the new route's details.

During this process, a critical compilation error, , repeatedly occurred in the frontend. The AI debugged this by relocating and then inlining the  logic to ensure it was correctly scoped and accessible where needed, thereby resolving the compilation issue.

Final testing confirmed that the  is now fully functional: it opens, displays a comprehensive list of commodity-specific terminals (e.g., 38 terminals for Aluminum), and the application's Piracy Scores (on a 0-100 scale) are correctly calculated and displayed for these routes. The system successfully processes data from the web crawling source through the backend to the frontend.

A minor, non-critical issue was noted: a UI layering problem (a modal-overlay) might sometimes prevent direct clicks on the alternative routes within the dropdown table, although the underlying logic for selecting and updating routes is sound.
